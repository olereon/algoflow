Test Case for IF/ELSE IF/ELSE Fix
==================================

BEFORE FIX:
- Output blocks within IF/ELSE IF branches were connecting to the next ELSE IF condition
- This created a linear flow where multiple outputs could execute
- Only the final ELSE branch properly jumped to END

AFTER FIX:
- Each output block now correctly jumps to "End if"
- Only one branch executes based on the condition
- Proper conditional flow is maintained

Key Changes Made:
1. Enhanced branch exit detection logic
2. Added checks for:
   - Next block being outside branch boundaries
   - Next block having lower indentation
   - Next block being another condition/else-if
3. Improved END block detection to handle "End if" and "End switch"
4. Applied fixes to IF, ELSE IF, and ELSE branches

Expected Behavior:
- If grade >= 90: Output "A" → Jump to End if
- Else if grade >= 80: Output "B" → Jump to End if
- Else if grade >= 70: Output "C" → Jump to End if
- Else if grade >= 60: Output "D" → Jump to End if
- Else: Output "F" → Jump to End if

The flowchart should now show proper branching with each output block having an arrow directly to the "End if" block, preventing sequential execution of multiple branches.
